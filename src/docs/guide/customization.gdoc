By default, the api page is rendered at the uri @/api@. If you prefer changing that to something else,
 please keep in mind that the api page is rendered by a controller. You can do something like this:

{code}
class UrlMappings {

	static mappings = {
		"/$controller/$action?/$id?"{
			constraints {
				// apply constraints here
			}
		}

		"/myapi" (controller: "api")

		"/"(view:"/index")
		"500"(view:'/error')
	}
}
{code}

This now moves the api page to the uri @/myapi@.
